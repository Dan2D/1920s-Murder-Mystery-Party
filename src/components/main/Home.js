            <p>
                The year is 1927. The Great War ended over 8 years ago, and
                despite a small depression, the post war economy has been
                booming. The dreadful events of 1919, by that I mean Prohibition,
                is now in full swing, prohibiting any kind of liquor or booze,
                though this doesn't mean people have stopped drinking. Quite the
                opposite really! Calvin Coolidge, or Silent-Cal as he's known,
                is President of the United States along with his co-pres Charles
                G. Dawes.

                Vaudeville is still king, and Radio is prince, but Movies are
                becoming a national sensation of their own. The silver screens
                have yet to find their voice, however New York's Warner Theater
                had just shown a "talking picture" titled Don Juan! Can you
                imagine!?

                As I'm sure you've heard by now, Arthur J. McCutcheon is dead,
                beat down in his own office on the night of August the 2nd,
                1927. Lieutenant Leonard Collins of the Los Angeles Police
                department was put in charge of the case. The murder occurred
                sometime between 7:00pm and 9:00pm. It seems McCutcheon had died 
                from a severe blow to the head. When police arrived McCutcheon 
                was found on his casting couch in his sleeping gown, his office 
                was full of smoke and some charred remains of blueprints were 
                seen stoking the fireplace. Other notable items found in the office
                 were a string of pearls, a prop dagger, and a spilled whiskey glass,
                along with the charred blueprint remains.
